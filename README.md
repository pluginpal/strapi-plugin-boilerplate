## ‚è≥ How to use

This repository is meant to be a template for new plugins. It can be used as a starting point, giving you the resources to built a test-driven Strapi plugin.

After creating your copy of the template, do a find-replace through the code and change the following:

1. Change `boilerplate` (lowercase) to be the identifier of your plugin.
2. Change `Boilerplate` (uppercase) to be the human readable name of your plugin.

You're all set! Go make your plugin and write some tests!
